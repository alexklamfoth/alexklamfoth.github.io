Out of respect for Stepa J. Groggs, Parker and Ritchie decided to part ways with the name Injury Reserve, and in doing this they have released their final work of music. As the duo transition into their new alias "By Storm", Bye Storm serves as a memoir of what Injury Reserve was truly about.
The contents of the song are nothing short of ethereal, as the glitchy beat and and soft melody soothe the listener. The lyrical subject matter has to do with the loss of a close friend, talking about how one must continue to move forward. It is important that we remember those who we lost and how important they were to us, but we also must adapt.
A comfortably haunting song, we can see the emotions felt by Ritchie and Parker, but they assert us that they will keep moving forward and don't plan on stopping soon.
