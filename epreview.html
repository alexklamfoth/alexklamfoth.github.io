<p>Blackbox Life Recorder is a new EP from IDM artist and producer Aphex Twin. This EP is roughly 14 minutes of breakbeat drums partnered with an ambient atmosphere, something that Aphex Twin is no stranger to.

If there is one thing Aphex Twin can be praised on, its his ability to create a strong atmosphere in his music. This EP features some of Aphex Twins iconic atmospheric sound partnered with break drums and fast paced percussion. 
While the overall sound of the EP is certainly solid, I couldnt help but feel a bit uninspired when listening to the music. For this being the first new material from Aphex Twin in over 5 years I was certainly expecting to here something high quality, and while the quality of the music can be plainly heard, it lacks variety.
The EP starts to decline in variety after the fantastic opener track, after this first track it feels like a slow outro as the best part of the EP is already said and done. 
While this is certainly a solid release, I don't imagine myself returning to it very often as it feels overly plain in the 14 minute run time.
