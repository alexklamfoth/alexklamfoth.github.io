After mostly negative reviews on "Father of All...", the bands future has been uncertain. Fans were left doubtful in the bands capabilities, and its been complete silence from the band since then. With the announcing of their new album, two singles titled "The American Dream Is Killing Me" and "Look Ma, No Brains!" have been released. Reception of the two singles have been mostly positive as fans have noted the significant improvement over their previous work.

<p>Does Green Day still have it in them? Or will they ultimately prove that the bands best days are behind them? Saviors is expected to release in January 2024, so stay tuned until then!</p>
